I found this game in google play store [Indefinite: Interrogation Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.me.brandlibel.indefinite&hl=en_IN) by Brandon li.

I found the game so interesting so, i thought it clone it in javascript the game he made was in flash which i came to know after de-assembling it by the file extensions etc.

What do you think about its **JAVASCRIPT VERSION** ?
DO comment down.

## BUILD YOUR OWN IN A MINUTE

There are some random question i picked a different theme you may pick any depending upon your imagination. and can easily tune it to make your own one.

This shows that you need to a assign a question as

```
quiz[index] = new Question("___your question_____", "__option1___", "___option2___", "___option3____" , "____option4____");

```

as 

```

quiz[0] = new Question("What is your name?", "Ayush", "vicki", "mehul" , "kavya");

```

The game have 4 options and will appear in random.

In this way you can create easily.
if you like this then give it a like.

Thanks.

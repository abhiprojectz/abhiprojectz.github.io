well a big **YES** ,yeah **Marco** supports animations also it has prebuilt anims like fading, sliding, appearing, bouncing etc 

If you had heard of [motionia.js](https://github.com/abhiprojectz/motionia) then you are already familiar with the answer for the question that is animating elements by just line of code.

You may easily integrate it or may use within it 

## Fading up a text

use name fadeIn (In because its apperaing and similiar fadeOut for disappearing etc)

```
@motionia{animation_name}(content goes here)

```

That is accordion, button(works like a link), slideshow , popup, summarier etc!

### Browser Extension

Download our browser extension so that you can click on videos in your browser and have them automatically open up in FreeTube.

[Download for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/freetube-redirect/)

[Instructions for Google Chrome](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube/wiki/Browser-Extension)

## How does it work?
FreeTube uses a built in extractor to grab and serve data / videos.  The [Invidious API](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) can also optionally be used.  FreeTube does not use any official APIs to obtain data.  While YouTube can still see your video requests, it can no
longer track you using cookies or JavaScript. Your subscriptions and history are stored locally on your computer and never sent out.  Using a VPN or Tor is highly recommended
to hide your IP while using FreeTube.

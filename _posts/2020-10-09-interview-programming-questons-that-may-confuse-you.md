In this post i will answer your most confusion and challenging common questions on python programming language!
so let's discuss in a interesting way!

so these are some common questions oftenly asked!
There are many people who have one of the questions below:

 - how can i learn programming quickly?
 - how can i learn to code programming in 3 days?
 - how can i learn to code programming in 3 days?
 - how can i learn to code programming in 3 days?
 - how can i learn to code programming in 24 hrs?
 - how can i learn to code programming in 1 day?
 - how can i learn programing in faster way?
 - What are the most commonly used programming tools?

 The answer is: It depends person to person the only thing that actually work is practice hard , consistently and with keen focus!

 Only then you have a good command on programming language than ever.

 And if you can only devote a few nights per week to it, in as little as three months you can create apps. In earnest! You want it to happen immediately, and it won't. Of course, getting started is the hardest part.

 There are dozens of programming languages in the world:

+ Python.
+ Java.
+ Ruby/Ruby on Rails.
+ HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
+ JavaScript.
+ C Language.
C++

are some of them.

To understand how it works, reading the sample code is not enough. You need to actually run the code and tinker with it to gain a true understanding.

It's easy to go down the rabbit hole for hours while debugging, and there's no guarantee that you can fix the problem.

If youâ€™re trying to advance in your career or change careers completely, and you realize you need to master a programming language, you might wonder which one to learn. After all, it will take time and money to learn the language, so you want to make the right choice from the start.

Some people seem to be in the "do it later" mode, they just go with what they know so they can be productive later in their careers. This is where we are at now in programming: we're still talking about learning.

I'm sure you're in that camp right now, but you've got this feeling, and you want to start making some progress in your career. At the very least, you have to make a solid decision, not the

 To reproduce, simply look at the code; and when you have the code, read it and try to understand its meaning.

To make this easier, there's a very simple sample code that will give you a much better understanding of how to code a web application.

# The sample code consists of two parts:

- Test/Run code

- A class

- An abstract class

The class is a collection of methods for manipulating a set of fields of a Web form. The first part is the code to test your application. The second part is the code to create the abstract class of your class.

The next day's bug hunt usually brings a lot of new findings, and some are quite obvious. But then there will always be other bugs that can be addressed. 
We need to give people feedback before going to a debugging session


 It is best to move away from it for a few hours to stop this, and come back with a fresh perspective.

# how many programming language are in total?

There are aprroximately 9000+ languages in the world. This is really a huge number and every of them have thier own benefits & purposes.


  This is not only a sure way to help solve the dilemma, but hours of headache will also save you yourself.

## What is python programming language ?

Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language.

> Don't just depend on sample codes or source codes they help but i suggest you to practice first!


The sample code is packaged to be read by the reader with the inclusion of comments and instructions; but in fact it is very difficult to recreate from scratch.

Everyone learns differently, and it doesn't mean that there's something wrong with you just because one source doesn't make sense.

 The more detailed and detailed these discoveries are, the more often you will need to step away from the for a long time.
